			<h2 class="f-b">Abstract</h2>
			<p>We are born into a society with very defined rules and traditions, which we accept and follow without a
				question. In
				Western society, the Industrial Revolution, Descartes’philosophical views and the power of Christianity
				on society have
				made a big impact in the way we connect and view nature nowadays. We went from being part of nature to
				putting it as the
				object we observe, distancing ourselves from it more and more. We own everything in it and do what we
				want with it. We
				have made sure to prove our power over our surrounding and non-humans. Leading to the current Climate
				Crisis, we are
				causing our own suffering and we need to learn how to stop the pain. We need to finally understand that
				we are part of
				nature, and by understanding that we might be able to save ourselves.</p>

			<h2 class="f-b">Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Sometimes, I find myself spending hours that seem like minutes looking out of my window. Luckily, my
				window
				faces a
				clear empty sky and a canal accompanied by big leafy trees, which immediately make me more relaxed. I
				have
				to think how
				wonderful the things are, we take for granted.. And this thesis is about this, about what we take for
				granted. It is
				about nature, about our Mother Nature, Gaia in Greek mythology, the ancestral mother of all life, that I
				will write. The
				mother that we keep on damaging, burning, contaminating, destroying and abusing. Our home. The womb in
				which
				we were
				created.
			</p>

			<p>
				Why do we harm her? Who gave us humans the right to do as we please? Why do we abuse when we could value
				instead,
				treasure?
				Many Western religions are based on the anthropocentric viewpoint, which argues that human beings are
				the central or
				most significant entities in the world. Can we humans escape from this human–centered worldview?
			</p>

			<p>
				In this thesis I want to explore the relationship between humans and nature, including animals. More
				precisely, I want
				to answer the previous questions and research why and how we have learnt what we consider <i>culture</i> and
				the origins of
				our society’s anthropocentric view, by exploring different fields like philosophy, psychology, history,
				and religion.
			</p>

			<p>
				The motivation for this topic is to burst the bubble we are used living in, and help others and myself
				understand our
				surrounding with more clarity. Furthermore, I want this thesis to be a bit of an eye-opener that will
				lead us to a more
				empathetic and conscious society in which we are careful and thoughtful in the actions that we decide to
				make.
			</p>
			<p>

				Lastly, I want to go through an introspective trip to the past, analyzing what could have influenced me
				in finding this
				topic so relevant and find out what were the events that had such an impact in the way society became
				what it is
				nowadays and its relationship with its surrounding.

			<h2>My Nature</h2>
			<h3>Beginnings, context and first realizations</h3>
			<p>
				"Oh, this girl is going to have a hard time in life".  This is what my mum thought after
				coming to the rescue when she heard me crying my
				eyes out after I had killed an ant while playing in our bathroom when I was around 7
				years old. I remember killing it as a reflex, probably because I had seen others do that
				too, or maybe not. Then, immediately after, I started crying and thinking: “The ant was
				there, doing its thing not harming anyone, why did I have to kill it?”
				This and similar situations, added to my uncontrollable childhood hobby of <i>saving</i>
				objects that had broken at home from being trashed, <i>as if they were trash</i>. I couldn’t
				stop putting myself in the place of animals, objects, and nature, telling myself: “I
				wouldn’t want that to happen to me either.” <br> I always guessed it was just a personality trait, no
				one could tell me more than “You’re
				just a hypersensitive person, and that’s ok”, and so I was kind of content with that.
				But the older I got the more I was thinking: “But, why? Why do those things affect me so
				much more than to others?”
			</p>
			<p>In 2017, I came across a very interesting talk by James Wildman, a humane
				educator
				at the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida (ARFF). In this video, he tells the audience
				that the circles shown in the screen, a red and a blue one, are not the same size, and
				asks to raise their hands to the ones that think the red one is bigger than the blue one,
				and the other way around. With this <i>innocent</i> game, he makes the audience see that
				as well as in society, all that we have learnt, we have accepted and never questioned (1).
				Even though his case was about animal rights and how we eat, it can also be applied to many other cases.
				The key point here is to ask oneself:
				Why do I do what I do? Is it something I decided myself, or have I automatically absorbed it from
				society?
			</p>

			<p>As kids, we learn what our parents
				teach us and we believe that is the truth. The same happens to individuals in this family to which we
				belong, called society. We take what is given and without questioning it, we follow. But there’s a
				moment in
				life, for some, when we realize those things we thought were true or right, aren’t. We grow up and build
				our
				own personality.
				As a toddler I was exposed, as many other children, to cartoons from the cartoon conglomerate Walt
				Disney
				Pictures, from its
				cartoons characters such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy to its films The Lion King, The Beauty
				and
				the Beast, and Alice
				in Wonderland, to name a few. In all of these films we see animals, flowers and/or objects interacting
				as if
				they were human:
				with a voice, a personality, emotions, and human facial expressions. The decision of humanizing, or
				better
				said,
				anthropomorphizing1, was made with the intention of making the human viewer connect and understand the
				(hidden) message in a clearer way.
				That is, the more <i>human</i> we perceive the animal to be, the easier it is for us to relate to it and
				develop
				empathy. This can lead to some of the most absurd situations (2).</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./assets/img/figure2.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>(2) Still of Donald Duck eating a chicken leg.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Situations in which animal cartoons are anthropomorphized to a point that they become a
				hybrid between animal and human, animals behaving like humans forgetting they are
				animals themselves. This doesn’t happen only in Disney movies. Other examples that had a
				great impact on the distorted idea I had about non-humans and objects are cartoons such as
				The Looney Tunes and movies like Dr Dolittle. The last one is about the stories of a doctor
				and surgeon that can talk with animals in their own language and helps them treating them
				as his patients. In this movie, animals are given human voices, emotions, and gestures
				(3).</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./assets/img/figure3.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>(3) Eddie Murphy as Dr Dolittle, 1998.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>This can have negative effects on the viewer such as not being able to see the
				difference between animals and humans. It is no surprise I wished wholeheartedly, that my
				dog would start laughing and ask me to stop when I tickled her.</p>
			<p>This could be seen as a positive thing, since the anthropomorphization of all
				those characters would make me more respectful and empathetic. But is this really the right way to do
				it?
				It might not even be a surprise if I said that, at one point in my life, we owned
				six different animals: a hamster, a rabbit, a dog, a ferret, a turtle, and two parakeets. Our
				house, that looked like a mad house filled with animals, was so dreamy to me; I liked
				animals so much that I wanted more and more… I didn’t ever ask myself if we had too
				many, my love for them was blinding me.
				We gradually stopped having so many pets but the memory of it remained like a dream.
				Until one day, when I visited a zoo again after not having stepped in one for over ten
				years. There was something different. Did the zoo change or did I change? Did I change or
				did my perception change? Suddenly, the place I remember enjoying so much as a child
				looked so depressing, soul-less, and dark. I wanted to leave that place as fast as possible.
				Ever since, I felt guilt and shame and can’t stop wondering: Why do we do the things we
				do to non–humans?</p>

			<h2>Yesterday's Nature</h2>
			<h3>How the society I grew up in has been shaped</h3>
			<p>But first, what is nature? Nature is <i>the natural, physical, or material world
				or universe. It can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in
				general.</i> All that is part of the Earth.<br>In Greek mythology, Gaea represents the Earth. Gaea is life.
				She is all, the
				very soul of
				the earth and, for all intents and purposes, the Mother of Everything Beautiful in the
				world. Born spontaneously – either out of Nothingness or out of Chaos, she is the ancestral
				mother of all life.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./assets/img/figurefour.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>Mother Earth by Anrike Piel, 2019.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Even more, the term “Mother Earth” is recognized by the UN General
				Assembly as a common expression used to refer to the planet in various countries and regions.
				The term demonstrates the unavoidable interdependence between human beings, other
				living species and the globe. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often
				understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>
			<p>This separation is the result of an event that marked a major turning point in society: The
				Industrial Revolution, which consisted in the process of change from an agrarian and
				handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing in Europe and the
				United States, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840.
				The creation of factories in cities and the migration of the majority of the population from
				the countryside to the cities caused a major
				distancing from nature. In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities, while,
				nowadays, it’s nearly 50%.
				Formerly, humans had been part of nature; then they became the exploiters of nature.
				This didn’t only affect our daily lives in the sense that we moved from one location to
				another - leaving the countryside for the urban area -, but also our very perception of
				what we left behind.<br>Cities started growing at a very fast pace, the countryside surrounding became
				habitable area and field animals were rarely seen. During the first part of the Industrial
				Revolution, animals were used as machines, a phase in which the view of the
				philosopher René Descartes, which believed that animals were unfeeling machines,
				was confirmed (we will talk more in detail about Descartes later on). Eventually, the
				internal combustion engine replaced animals and once they were removed from streets
				and factories, they were treated as plain raw material. Animals moved from being
				considered a tool, to being required for food and processed like a manufactured
				commodity.<br>Nowadays, when we think about nature, we visualize hills, trees,
				and flower fields (4).</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./assets/img/figure4.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>(4) Scene from the Japanese-American series <i>Heidi, Girl of the Alps</i>, 1974.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>We owe the idealized concept of nature to Romanticism: an
				artistic, literary, musical and intellectual movement originated in Europe towards the end of the
				18th century. It was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as
				glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical. The
				idealization of nature was partly caused by the Industrial Revolution, which basically
				removed all signs of nature from the daily life replacing it with factories. Romantics wanted to get rid
				of the
				separation
				between subject and object, between man and the natural world. Furthermore, they
				were distrustful of the human world and believed having a close connection with nature
				was mentally and morally healthy.</p>
			<p>However, not only the urbanization of societies shaped the society in which we live
				now. A society is also shaped by two very important elements that dictate the belief and
				thought of this society: religion and philosophy.</p>
			<h3 class="subsubtitlechapter">
				Religion
			</h3>
			<p>As the historian Lynn White says in his essay <i>The Historical Roots of our Ecological
				Crisis</i> (1967), "What people do about their ecology depends on what they think about
				themselves in relation to things around them.""
				Religious views have a strong influence on the perspective that may allow people to
				ignore the problems or may force them to confront the issues. That perspective on the
				world is often unnoticed or omitted and it can differ completely from one religion to
				another, even from one religious practitioner to another.<br> Being born in Europe means, that
				Christianity will be the
				religion that will rule your
				life in a way or another, either you are a practicing or not. It is true that the way we think
				and talk are no longer considered Christian, but we still find some traces of it into our
				culture. As a simple example, we might say we are atheists and still celebrate
				Christmas (or Feast of the Nativity). Originally, Christmas was meant to commemorate
				the birth of Jesus Christ, although nowadays has been turned into the festive period of
				the year, which promotes consumerism more than anything else. But that’s another
				topic. Going back to Christianity, what did it tell people about their relationship with
				nature, their environment?</p>
			<p>Christianity got from Judaism a story of creation of the world and is as follows: God
				created light and darkness, then he created the Earth and its plants, animals, birds, and
				fishes. Finally he created Adam and then Eve to keep him from being lonely. Man
				named all animals confirming his superiority over them. Man is not part of nature
				because he is made in God’s image.
			</p>

				<figcaption>"In antiquity people thought the sun turned around the Earth, haha so stupid. – Now you
					think that the
					Earth turns around you." By Flavita Banana, 2019.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>White states that: “Especially in its Western form, Christianity is the most
				anthropocentric religion the world has seen. […] not only establishing a dualism of man
				and nature but also insisting that it is God's will that man exploit nature for his proper
				ends.” The following verse of the Bible strikingly illustrates this point:</p>
				<br><br>
			<p><i><b>Genesis 1:26</b> <br>And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them
					have
					dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and
					over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth</i></p>
			<br><br>
			<p>In antiquity, every tree, every mountain, every river, every rock had its guardian spirit.
				This was pagan animism (animism being used as a term for the belief system of
				many indigenous people), the belief that places, objects and creatures possess a
				spiritual essence, that a soul also exists in them and not only in humans. It was
				important that the spirit of a particular case was appeased before a mountain was mined
				or before a tree was cut, and so on. With Christianity, the spirits in natural objects that
				protected nature from man vanished.<br>Going back to the question of “What did [Christianity] tell
				people about their
				relationship with nature, their environment?” We might find answers when reading the
				Bible and, although this is one way of interpreting the holy book, led mostly by Lynn
				White’s work, I find it especially interesting and strong. Although the Bible isn’t the
				justification for environmental abuse, it still had a strong influence in the way our
				surrounding has been and is perceived.</p>
			<h3 class="subsubtitlechapter">
				Philosophy
			</h3>
			<p> Do we humans fear nature? Have we always feared nature? Have we been so aware of
				its power that we needed to tame it and control it? According to the art critic, novelist,
				painter and poet John Berger, “The life of a wild animal becomes an ideal, an ideal
					internalized as a feeling surrounding a repressed desire.” To me, what Berger comes to
				say is that we idealize the way non-animals live and we wished we could live like them,
				and that’s our <i>repressed desire</i>.<br>Philosophy is concerned with the question of how an
				individual lives,
				could and should
				live, and therefore, strongly influences a society. Coccia, in his book <i>The Life of Plants</i>,
				criticizes the philosophy we know and says: “Philosophy seeks at all costs to be human
				and humanistic, to be included among the human and social sciences like all others. (…)
				Philosophy has turned into a sort of Don Quixote of contemporary knowledge, engaged
				in an imaginary struggle against the projections of its own spirit; on into a Narcissus who
				looks back at the ghosts of its past, now empty souvenirs in a provincial museum.”3 With
				this, Coccia argues that philosophy has focused on an anthropocentric viewpoint, seeing
				human beings as the central or most significant entities in the world. Also, this philosophy
				considers that humans are superior and completely separate from nature and states that
				human life is especially valuable while other entities (including animals, plants, mineral
				resources, and so on) are simply resources that can be exploited for the benefit of
				humankind. This is a basic belief embedded in many Western religions and philosophies.
				René Descartes, the father of modern Western philosophy, held that only humans are
				conscious. Only humans have minds and souls, can learn, only humans have language.
				Therefore only humans are deserving of compassion. According to Descartes, animals
				have only a body and not a soul. This distinguishes humans from animals, and places
				humans at the center of the world. Descartes maintained that animals cannot reason and
				do not feel pain; that animals might be living organic creatures, but automata, like
				mechanical robots. Unfortunately for animals, [Western] science adopted his view.4 <br>
				In opposition, the philosopher David Schweitzer rejected this view. Schweitzer was
				a pioneer in the world of animal protection and strongly believed that “Until we extend
				our circle of compassion to all living things, humanity will not find peace.” All living
				creatures are considered as one: “I am life that wills to live in the midst of life that wills to
				live”.
			</p>
			<p> Although other philosophers like Schweitzer were opposed to the dualism by
				Descartes, this one had a strong effect on the society of the time. It might have been the
				very beginning of our modern society: The human being as the protagonist of their own
				story, completely separated from animals, declaring the superiority of humans over
				other species.</p>

			<h2>Today's Nature</h2>
			<h3>The current Human-Nature relationship</h3>
			<p>
				Going back to what I have been wondering for many years: Why do we do the things we
				do to non–humans? I venture to say that one of human beings’ current biggest fears
				might be the future of their existence under the climate crisis. Trying to find solutions to
				prolong the human existence. It is well known that the climate crisis has been caused by
				human activity: temperatures rising, sea level increasing, forests drying out or burning
				down, animal species going extinct. Now the damage is done and we do have to find
				solutions. To find solutions we must get back to my first question: how did we get here?
				And why? Our human history of making other species suffer has led to a realistic near
				future scenario, where it is our turn to do the suffering.<br>Dr. Kahn, director of the Human
				Interaction With
				Nature and Technological Systems
				(HINTS) Lab in Washington, answers this question with a theory that he named
				<i>generational amnesia</i>, which means that in every generation the amount of
				environmental degradation can increase but each generation finds that degradation as
				non-degraded. Each generation perceives their environmental impact as natural,
				because it can’t be compared with anything else. A comparative experiential baseline is
				missed. As an example I could talk about a field I used to visit together with my family
				as a child. It was a wild and leafy field in which we would let our dog run freely for hours.
				Every time we visited, the field was less wild and less leafy… it turned out that there
				was a plan of turning that field into a golf course. Around 12 years later we went back to
				that spot with my 10-year-old cousin who never got the chance to meet that wild and
				leafy field. For her, the golf course was normal, it was just there and it was ok, she
				couldn’t compare the before with the after, she couldn’t see what actually had had to be
				destroyed in order for that golf course to be there. And this is problematic because
				people then don’t recognize that there is a problem and if we can’t recognize that, we
				cannot solve that problem.
			</p>
			<p>
				Is it possible to reconcile humans and nature? A first step to get closer to this
				connection could be evaluating if we would accept that the things we do to others would
				be done to us the same way. Here comes the memorable quote by the Chinese
				philosopher Confucius: “Don't do unto others what you don't want done unto you.”
				<br>With his book <i>Topsy Turvy World</i>, the Berlin based artist Georg Barber, also known as
				Atak, depicts images of rabbits shooting hunters, lions keeping humans and more,
				subverting images that have become <i>everyday</i> in order to show their grotesqueness
				and perversion (6).
			</p>

			<br>

				<img src="./assets/img/figure6.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>(6) Illustrations from the book <i>Topsy Turvy World</i> by Atak, 2013.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>While the images might be seen as silly or simply funny to some, to others, it is a
				moment of realization and beginning of de-centralization of the human being in the
				anthropocentric society we live in.
				How many of us have confidently said how much we love animals and how much we
				love nature? Many of us love our pet dog/cat, or admired the great elegance of a horse,
				or have desperately needed a walk in the forest to feel better or simply to escape the
				urban life for a while.
				<br>
				Since the beginning of our species we had a daily and intimate connection with the
				natural world. That need to connect - deeply and intimately - with nature is still with us;
				it's part of our human nature. This is known as <i>biophilia</i>, which translates to “love of
				life”, a term first used by the humanistic philosopher and social psychologist Erich
				Fromm to describe the psychological orientation of being attracted to everything that is
				alive and vital. Humans are innately attracted to nature and we can find as an example
				the symbolic use of nature in our language. We regularly use idioms such as <i>blind as a
				bat</i>, <i>to horse around</i>, <i>fishy</i>, among others, which are clear evidences of biophilia.
				<i>“Animals lent their name or character to a quality, which like all qualities was
					mysterious”</i>5. Such affiliations with natural metaphors seem to come from times when
				people had a much closer contact with nature than most do today. Biophilia is not only
				limited to the tendency of affiliating with nature but it also extends to the beneficial
				effects that we get when looking at it.<br>
				We, humans, take the position of the subject and put nature as the object we look at,
				always taking that distance by observing it as something separate from us. Following
				this same concept, Berger expresses that also animals are always the objects we
				observe and the fact they can observe us is not important, all we know about them is
				proof of our power which is what separates us from them6.
				It’s thought that human separation from the natural world occurred together with the
				development of technology, changing human interactions with nature. The dependence
				of the human species on technology has reduced the human desire to connect with
				nature, or also called, biophilic behavior. The biologist Edward O.Wilson and others
				have argued that this decline could cause the loss of human respect for the natural
				world. In fact, the loss of desire to interact with nature and the little appreciation of life
				forms that support human survival are potential factors that contribute to destruction of
				the environment and the fast pace in which species become extinct.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve always been fascinated about the contradictory behavior of human beings
				towards nature. We exploit it, chop it, burn it, contaminate it, but at the same time we
				desire it. Why do humans tend to destroy what we love? We might not do those actions
				as individuals but those are clearly and systematically done by our species. Especially
				in cities, we ignore the real nature but seek a fake one and we introduce it into our
				houses, into our daily lives. The representation of nature on different surfaces creates a
				living illusion.
				<br>
				My fellow student Kexin Hao explores this phenomenon on her Instagram account
				<i>portrayed_landscapes</i> in which she publicly posts imagery of depicted nature
				blended in our daily lives. “The more we portray nature, the more distant and
					opposed we are from it.” <br> We need to see nature in our
				daily lives but ignore to really
				feel it. “There are so many
				urban objects that are
				decorated with landscape
				prints and wraps, everywhere
				I go, in every city and every
				corner of the world. They
				suggest that the nature
				“WOULD better be there” but “
				IS not there”, this contrast of
				ideals and reality, and the
				absence of realness is
				embarrassing.”
			</p>
			<p> She continues with “the landscape is portrayed,
				fantasied, longed for and impulsed, after the landscape is expelled from the urban
				space. Then, she ends with “I can understand [now] how much people urge to have
				nature in urban spaces, how little they care if it is real or not, and how little they
				understand nature” (7).</p>

			<p>These <i>portrayed landscape</i> in our daily lives might
				have made us even more distant than what we would have expected in the first place.
				Similar to this is the tendency to collect sunsets on our phones, a trend that came along
				the launch of cellphones with cameras. The constant need of collecting those moments
				in our phones disconnect us from reality. What happens when we substitute the
				exploration of reality to that of technological reality? What happens when we start
				exploring the outside world from the inside? “As we lose the richness and depth of
				pervasiveness of interaction with nature, we shift the
				baseline of what is recognized as healthy nature
				experience.” Says Dr Kahn, author of Technological
				Nature: Adaptation and the Future of Human Life.
				But does that only happen with nature? Among the
				so many trends that society has come up with, some
				have achieved the realm of the absurd. To start with
				one we could start with the trend of owning a very
				specific dog breed. This considerably new trend,
				starting probably with Paris Hilton carrying her
				Chihuahua everywhere in her purse in the early
				2000s, has caused a remarkable disconnection
				between human and other (domestic) animals (8).

			<p>In the article <i>'Fashion accessory' dogs being
				dumped in record numbers at animal shelter</i> from
				2011, Lara Alford, manager from The Blue Cross, a
				rehoming center for pets in the UK, states that 'some people
				bought [dogs] as fashion accessories after celebrities
				like Paris Hilton made them trendy. Although people
				think they look great when they see someone famous
				with one, they often don't realize what a responsibility they are taking on.”
				<br>In the past, domestic animals were kept because of a useful purpose: guard dogs
				would protect the house, cats to hunt mice, among others. Nowadays, the family unit in
				which the animals find themselves lacks earth, other animals, natural temperatures, and
				so on. The pet is often sterilized, with limited contact with other animals, with little
				chance to exercise as much as needed, and is given artificial food. This may be the
				thought behind the expression that pets come to resemble their masters or mistresses 9
				(9).

			<p>There is a tension between the roles of animals as companions to humans,
				and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. Humanizing animals makes
				them lose their identity;they feel frustrated,anxious, and insecure.
				It is morally reprehensible because it imposes unnecessary suffering on the animal. The
				owners impose disrespectful human rules that go from hairstyles to clothing, and that goes against
				the identity of the animal. This tendency of <i>collecting</i> has gone beyond the
				<i>standard</i> pets: nowadays, pets can be cats, dogs, birds, hamsters, fish, and so on.
				Our desire to own animals unusual as pets often leads us to bring wild animals home.
				As an example, a few years back, YouTube videos went viral because of the <i>super
				cute</i> creature in them, a pet slow loris. This animal, which is native to Southeast Asia,
				became highly demanded because of the popularity of those videos. This kind of
				intense attachment towards other animals can lead to illegal trade of wild animals. In
				addition to that, there have been cases of a pet chimp attacking its owner or a big cat
				hurting its keeper and they are not rare, what is rare is that we are still surprised by
				animals behaving like animals (10).
			</p>

			</figure>
			<p>This leads us back to the question of why anthropomorphism is a bad thing. While
				the act of giving human attributes to animals, nature and objects can help us in
				connecting and emphasizing with them in a way that could lead to their preservation, we
				are still positioning ourselves as the center. That is, we are only accepting the behavior
				of non-human creatures when it resembles ours. Can’t we not feel empathy and respect
				just by letting them be their own selves? Furthermore, anthropomorphism is often
				limited to social, intelligent animals, to which we can relate more, such as chimpanzees,
				pandas, polar bears and dolphins – often at the expense of species we find less <i>cute</i>
				or <i>attractive</i> or that we find we don’t connect much with in any way, such as chickens,
				insects, or fish. This leads to speciesism, which is the differing treatment or moral
				consideration of individuals based on the species they belong to. One of the most
				common comparisons is that of the cow and the dog; the cow is bred and killed for food
				while dogs are treated as companion animals.</p>
			<p>Why do we anthropomorphize the non-anthropomorphic? Even if it is to seek
				connection with non-human creatures, we must question our motivations. For example,
				are we acting merely out of self-interest of being less lonely, or are we fully respecting
				the autonomy of the creature we seek to connect with? <br> Yet this kind of toxic relationship and the
				tendency of
				owning nature don’t only apply
				to animals. One of the most common trends in the last years has been houseplants.
				Because nearly half of the world's population lives in urban areas and mostly in small
				spaces, our connection with nature has been reduced. Although we might have a few
				parks around, we are not in touch with real nature anymore. The easiest way to feel
				closer to nature on a daily basis is by having
				houseplants in your home (11).</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./assets/img/figure11.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>(11) Home inspiration by arrivaldeparture.com</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The trend has extended to all sorts of plants, including
				tropical plants in countries where its weather is
				everything but tropical but for some reason
				(probably caused by climate change) they survive
				in areas where they were not meant to exist. The
				different temperatures we exposed them to and the
				polluted urban air, the lack of real light and the
				excess of artificial light, the chemical products we
				spray them with, the lack of space, of proper care
				or patience to cure a plant…how many times have I
				rescued a plant from the street that just needed
				some time, some care? Thrown out in the street
				like a broken and unfixable object that can be
				easily replaced by a new one. While owning exotic
				plants might make us feel original, this shows the
				way actually perceive nature. Don’t we also pick
				wild flowers to make our own decorative flower
				bouquets? Both plants and flowers become part of our home-décor, another piece of
				furniture or a simple object. With the success of Instagram, more and more people are
				open to share their interiors, which rarely lack at least one big plant. The more plants,
				the better, but, is owning plants not part of the same tradition of appropriating nature, as
				owning animals is? Plants owners tend to treat their plants as their babies, making them
				depend completely on their owners for water and sunlight. Is there a big difference
				between a tropical plant in a pot in our living room and a fish in an aquarium?
				<br>The transformation of a plant into a decorative object has extended to the design
				field. The urge to incorporate nature into our lives seems so big; we have created the
				most curious objects and spaces. From houses incorporated in a mountain – as
				architect Alberto Ponis does - to growing trees into objects such as chairs, lampshades,
				and mirror frames. The latter is a project by furniture designer Gavin Munro and
				although it does sound like a good way to reduce wood waste, in the process, trees are
				trained along pre-defined routes following a plastic mold and manipulated to create the
				exact shape of the desired object. While these seem ideas that could lead us to a more
				respectful/environmental friendly way of living, we are still on the way of the natural
				course of, in this case, a tree or even a mountain.
			</p>
			<p> Here I find myself again with the same, yet somewhat reformulated question: Why is
				it that human desires seem so persistent and dominant, we want them to be met at all
				cost? <br> Opposite to the previous design ideas, there is the technique called <i>biomimicry</i>, or
				biomimetics, which aims to solve human problems emulating elements of nature. Us
				humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence.
				Nature has taught us things and we could solve a lot of (engineering) problems thanks
				to it. Problems like environmental exposure tolerance, self-healing abilities and
				hydrophobicity (also known as impermeability). Another example I came across with a
				long time ago was a video of a tailorbird sewing its own nest with plant fiber as the
				thread. While watching at the precise work of the tailorbird I couldn’t stop thinking about
				the mental switch that just had happened in my head: We don’t know everything and
				what we know, is only thanks to nature.

			<h2>Tomorrow's Nature</h2>
			<h3>Understanding of the Natural World</h3>
			<p>
				<br>It’s not impossible to imagine a respectful society in which humans coexist with nature.
				Everything we need is given to us, and the way to be thankful is by respecting it.
				Therefore, the leading question of this fourth and final chapter is: Can humans reconnect
				with nature?
				<br>The pandemic we experienced in early 2020 has been affecting us in many ways and
				remains in our memory as a traumatic experience, regardless of individual experience.
				What is certain is, during the lockdown period, the longing for nature increased
				considerably. Is it true then, that we don’t appreciate what we have until we actually loose
				it? Or, slightly different, that the inaccessibility was the main cause of its desire?
				As previously mentioned, our tendency to connect with our environment is part of our
				human nature. Many people that could be considered as <i>conformists</i> or maybe even
				<i>deniers</i> of what is happening or can be done to avoid what is actually happening, might
				be familiarized with the phrase “We will adapt”, meaning that whatever happens to the
				environment, the nature or the planet, we’ll adapt, we’ll be Ok. Dr Kahn criticizes that
				adaptation is not singular; it’s not just one change what we have to do. There are different
				types of adaptation such as “genetic change, homeostasis, acclimatization, addiction,
					habituation, equilibration, assimilation, and accommodation.” Only by being able to go
				through all those types of adaptation we will be able to be Ok.
				<br>“We will adapt” seems to be a fruitful starting point, when talking about the biggest natural
				crisis we’ve ever experienced: that of climate change.
			</p>
			<h3 class="subsubtitlechapter">
				Climate Crisis
			</h3>
			<p>The Climate Crisis is nothing new, we all have seen, read and heard what are its
				consequences: rise of sea level, drought, floods, rise of temperatures, and so on. There
				are studies and information within reach that everyone has access to. Yet for some
				reason not much is done about it. The philosopher Slavoj Zizek illustrates this problem by
				pointing at our belief that garbage, that it vanishes, disappears… But garbage just moves
				from one place to another, always being part of the world. “I feel that man, living in our
					region, is simply suffocating in his own life among the garbage since there is nowhere to
					take it, nowhere to sweep it out – we have lost the border between garbage space and
					non-garbage space. Everything is covered up, littered with garbage – our homes, streets,
					cities”.
				<br> When it comes to love, Zizek states that if we love the world in which we live, we shall
				love it with all its imperfections, in this case the imperfections he refers to is the garbage.
				Real love does not idealise the other, one also has to love the imperfections of the other,
				so we should love the world including all the garbage in it.
				This idea is interesting when we think about the present, about our surroundings and all
				the garbage that has already been produced. However, making peace with the current
				roaming garbage may not exactly redeem us from our actions: in fact, making peace with
				garbage may actually pave the way for a continuance of growing waste. Yet without the
				guilty feeling attached to it.

			<p>
				In his documentary <i>Life on Earth</i>, the natural
				historian David Attenborough emphasizes on the
				collective behavior of humans throughout history
				and all its striking consequences. The decline of
				our planet’s resources is rather new, only in the
				last hundred years the change has been drastic.
				We consume the Earth until its destruction,
				nothing can stop us. Some habitats are
				disappearing, no ecosystem is safe, not even the
				seas. Half of fertile soil of the Earth is farmland
				and we turned wild animals into domestic
				animals. The 70% of birds are domestic birds,
				mostly chicken, we humans represent one third
				of the weight of all mammals, the other 60% are
				animals that we breed for food, the rest of the
				animals represent only 4% (from mice to
				whales). This is our world, a world ruled by us
				and for us. There’s no much left for the others,
				the non-human world has disappeared. We’ve
				infested the world.
				<br> As possible solutions, Attenborough proposes
				that we should replant the Earth, restore
				biodiversity, very easy actions that could benefit
				us all. The way to do it is to slow down or cease natality, put simply, to have less children.
				On top of that, changing our diet would be the biggest and most effective change. The
				planet Earth cannot bear thousands of millions of carnivores, there is not enough room.
				For each predator there are more than hundred prey, every time we eat a piece of meat
				we also demand a large amount of space. If we all had a vegetarian diet, we would need
				less of the ground we have now. Forests are the best technology to block carbon and are
				the center of biodiversity. The more dense they are, the more effective to catch the
				carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
				Only by accepting this reality can we do something about it. It’s about time that our
				species cease to increase.
			</p>
			<p>Once I came across a quote from an unknown source that said: “It's not the deer
				that crosses the road, it's the road that crosses the forest". Although this quote might
				leave some unimpressed, it definitely made an impact on me. To me, it is about switching
				the position in which we’re used to see things, the way we observe the world around us.
				It’s that moment of actually questioning what came first. Coccia states that “plants are the
				real mediators: they are the first eyes that appeared and opened themselves onto the
				world, they are the gaze that came to perceive it in all its forms. The world is, above all,
				everything the plants could make of it. They are the ones who made our world, even
				though the status of this making is quite different from that of any other activity of living
				beings.”</p>
			<p>A few months ago I made an online questionnaire and asked several people from
				my circle of (Facebook) friends if they felt positive about the future considering the
				Climate Crisis we’re currently experiencing. The 85,96% of people answered <i>no</i>. This
				left only a 14,04% of people that still had some hope. When asked how did they visualize
				the Earth in the far future, many responses had things in common: grey, dirty, dry in
				some areas and flooded in others, plastic everywhere, impersonal. While, when asked
				how did they visualize a dreamy eco-friendly planet, the responses varied but many
				coincided that in a utopian world there would be less humans, less meat, more trees,
				more animals and blue skies.
				<br>There are two different positions that humans can take in relation to environmental
				issues. One is the position of knowing that we are all threatened but not believing it
				entirely because the thought of the world ending is unimaginable, because we are not
				wired to imagine something like that, and we are not ready to do anything radical to
				change our way of living either. Opposite to this position is the other one which is
				knowing the threat, knowing that nothing can actually be done to influence the process
				which may lead to one’s ruin but it is too difficult to not do anything about it even though
				whatever is done might be completely meaningless. The latter would bring us to Green
				Capitalism, which is the view that sees natural resources as capital and its profits
				should be used for the protection and sustainability of the environment.
			</p>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>(12) Meme from newyearsrevolution.com</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Many companies had to rethink their
				marketing strategy towards environmentally conscious customers by marketing as <i>green</i> products
				such as organic food, less toxic house cleaners, green cars and such but “to save the humans,
					what we need is not green cars, not electric cars, but massively fewer cars.” After
				all the green initiatives, the ecological contradiction of capitalism still
				remains: maximizing profit and saving the planet are completely opposite
				and cannot be aligned. Green capitalism is not a solution. It’s a delusion. There is no capitalist
				solution to our ecological crisis. We either save our planet or capitalism,but not both at the same
				time.14
			</p>
			<p>Our society has been very active in the last years trying to find ways to produce less
				waste in an individual level and some even make drastic changes in the way they live by
				living the most natural life possible. However, thinking we can connect with nature by
				leaving our materialistic life behind and making use exclusively of what the Earth offers
				us, is nothing new. Living an eco-friendly life has become more popular in our western
				societies and something that we should take into account is that some of the practices
				that we <i>came up with</i> in order to live a greener life might have come from indigenous
				people. This phenomena is called “whitewashed hope”. We should be careful to not
				<i>take</i> certain land practices from Indigenous cultures without knowing their context.
				Instead, we may pursue the embrace of deeper Indigenous worldviews... Inspiring a
				consciousness shift that will support us to go from a dominant culture of supremacy and
				domination to one founded on reciprocity, respect, and interrelations with all beings—including, of
				course,
				among all
				humans. Are we capable of respecting nature while also
				respecting other cultures? “Indigenous people make up only 6.2% of our global
					population, they steward 80% of Earth’s biodiversity while managing over 25% of her
					land. Indigenous worldviews are the bedrocks that our agricultural practices and lifeways
				arise from.” Indigenous people are deeply connected with nature; the two are equal
				and depend on each other, nature is highly respected and they have a strong sense of
				place and belonging. How can we, western people, make a consciousness shift, without
				appropriating traditions from other cultures?
				<br>Nature will find its way to survive as it always does, we find several examples in
				areas that, for different reasons, have been abandoned and in which nature has found its
				way to take over. Following this thinking, Emanuele Coccia believes so as well
				when he says <i> “Plants never cease to develop and grow, to construct new organs and
					new parts of their own body. Their body is a morphogenetic industry that knows no
					interruption”.</i>
			</p>

			</figure>
			<p>The Climate Crisis, then, becomes a personal issue, a human issue. We are not just
				damaging the Earth but we’re causing our own extinction. Only by making the problem
				personal, we understand the seriousness of the matter, because, again, of our
				anthropocentric view of the world. When we realize that Climate Change is about the
				survival of the human race we might be able to do something about it. Once we decide to
				do something about it, such as changing our diet, we also have to be aware of not
				“borrowing” indigenous practices that can’t be adapted to the way we live.
				We must understand once and for all that we do not rule the world, that there are ways to
				save ourselves without appropriating anything from other cultures and that we all belong
				to the same space and we are all connected. Why wouldn’t we lower down our imperialist
				behavior for the benefit of the entire world, for a change?</p>

			<h2 class="f-b">Conclusion</h2>

			<p>By doing an intense research on the history of how our society has disconnected itself
				from nature and my observation of the current state of it, I was able to answer many of
				the questions that have been roaming in my head for many years now. When observing
				different situations in which humans were mistreating and damaging animals and their
				surrounding I couldn’t stop wondering what led us to that behavior: Why do we treat
				nature as a mere decoration that can be moved or removed? Why do we objectify it?
				Why do we <i>collect</i> animals?<br>I learned what were the main things that influenced our society to what
				it is nowadays and understood that only by knowing the past, we can create a better future. It was
				shocking to see and accept that I’m part of this whole society and, despite of my good
				intentions, I (indirectly) contributed to this Western behavior towards our surrounding.
				This research made me more aware of the fact that we were and still are part of nature
				although we have forgotten about it, also to be even more empathetic towards it and to
				be more careful about how my actions can affect others. At first I was scared of the things
				I was going to find but the more I found and the more I read, the better I wanted to
				become as a human.<br>It was challenging to deal with such a big topic and I’m aware I haven’t talked
				about many
				things but this research is not ending here; this is just the beginning. I aim to continue
				evolving to build a deeper connection with the space I inhabit and the creatures that
				coexist in it.</p>
